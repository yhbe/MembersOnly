# Members Only

[Link to project](https://membersonly1.onrender.com/)

MembersOnly is a simple web application built using Node.js, Express, and React that allows users to create and view posts. However, only members can see the author of the post.

The MembersOnly project was created as a learning exercise to help me improve my skills with Node.js and Express, and to practice implementing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.
