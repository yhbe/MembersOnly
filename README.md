# Members Only

MembersOnly is a simple web application built using Node.js, Express, and React that allows users to create and view posts. However, only members can see the author of the post.

The MembersOnly project was created as a learning exercise to help me improve my skills with Node.js and Express, and to practice implementing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.MembersOnly uses token-based authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authorize access to certain routes on the server side. When a user successfully logs in, a JWT token is generated and sent back to the client as part of the response.
